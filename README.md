### Description

This is a pretty much a fully fledged instant messenger (without encryption, oh well). It has the works, multiple chat rooms, instant messaging, avatars, and even some stuff i might have forgotten about. I just dug this project back up in hopes to maybe spark some interest in it. Some things may be unfinished and please let me know of any changes you think i could make to make it better. Any help is welcome. Enjoy.
